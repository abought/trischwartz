# Contributions welcome

Trischwartz was originally created for a very specific purpose, but we hope
it will be useful to others, and there is always room to improve.

We welcome all suggestions, issue reports, and pull requests. As this is 
an open source project, it may take us a few days to respond. Below are some 
tips to help make the most of your contribution.

We may not be able to serve every feature request.

## Pull requests
Submitting your own code is a powerful way to help ideas move forward. Here 
are a few suggestions to help us make the most of it:  

* All new code should have unit tests. We aim for test coverage to be as

* Commit messages should be clear and specific.
